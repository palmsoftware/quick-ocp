# quick-ocp
Quickly spawns an OCP cluster using [OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) for use on Github Actions.

This will work on the free tier lowest resource runners at the moment with additional runner support added later if needed.

Read more about Github Actions runners [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

If you are looking to quickly spawn Kubernetes in your Action runner, try [quick-k8s](https://github.com/palmsoftware/quick-k8s).
